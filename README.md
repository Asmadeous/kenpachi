# Code challenge project

 This project comprises of three different assignment tackling various challenges assigned to each student and they are as follows:

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

In this challenge we are expected to provide a way to generate the grade output from a particular score range (0-100).Parameters of the grades are: A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
The program should take a user input and generate the grade output of the user.
*If  the user input "50" it should output a grade of "C".
*if the user input is 80 it should output a grade of "E".

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

In this challenge we create a program that takes the input of the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Here we create a program that calculates the net salary of a given individual from input of only two parameters benefits and salary. The program contains a list of functions that are nested to calculate the result.
